Name: Deshawn Delice
Programming Language: Java 14.0.1
Compiler: javac 14.0.1
Development Environment: Eclipse IDE, version 2022-06 (4.24.0)
Instructions:
Once the folder is downloaded and extracted, cd into the directory containing Main.java and compile using 'javac Main.java'.
The program can then be executed using 'java Main'. The program will then prompt the user for a file to parse. All test files
given to us are provided in the folder and any other desired test files should be placed in the same folder containing Main.
Type the name of the desired parse file, i.e. ab.txt, and press Enter, and the program will print that the file was parsed successfully
or that an error was found, stating the line and index of the first discovered error, as well as the function that was in scope
when the error was discovered. When one of these two outcomes has materialized, it will then prompt you to type 'y' if you would like
to parse another file in the folder, or any other character if you would like to end the program. If you type 'y', you must then type in
the name of the next desired program to be parsed.
NOTE: That at David's request I have used the scanner class for taking the initial user input of the file name, please let me
know if this is an issue as I have also included an alternative input option that does not use the scanner class.
